# Weather App Build and Run

Api : https://home.openweathermap.org/

cd Documents/Github/Weather-App

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

or 

pip install requests pandas
pip show requests pandas




# Concepts Used in the Weather App

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Encapsulation: Encapsulated weather-related functionalities in WeatherAPI, HistoryService, and WeatherApp classes.
   - Class and Object: Used classes like Weather, WeatherAPI, and WeatherApp to represent and organize logic.
   - Class Methods: Defined a `from_api_response` method in the Weather class for constructing objects from API responses.

2. Error Handling
   - Used try-except blocks in WeatherAPI to handle potential errors during API calls.

3. Modular Programming
   - Divided the app into separate modules (api, models, services) to make the code reusable and maintainable.

4. Libraries and Packages
   - Used external libraries like requests for HTTP calls and pandas for managing tabular data.

5. Input and Output
   - Used the input() function to take user input (city names and commands).
   - Used print() to display weather data and history.

6. Loops and Conditionals
   - Used a while loop to keep the app running until the user exits.
   - Used if-elif-else statements to process user commands.

7. String Manipulation
   - Formatted strings to display weather data with readable units.

8. Data Structures
   - Used a list to store weather search history.

9. Importing and Reusability
   - Organized reusable functionality in separate files and imported them in app.py.
   - Demonstrated importing from both built-in and external libraries.

10. API Integration
    - Integrated the OpenWeatherMap API using the requests library.

11. File Structure and Maintainability
    - Followed a professional folder structure to keep the project modular and maintainable.
